# rock-paper-scissors
A simple game of rock, paper, scissors.

    Through this project I learned how to add minor animations using CSS as well as creating a simple UI to work with JS
instead of using only the console. I would like to come back and add some finishing touches at some point, but for now I feel like that would take time away from progessing further in The Odin Project as what I have displayed currently demonstrates working knowledge.
